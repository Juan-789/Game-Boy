The five classic components of a computer are input, output, memory datapath, and control. the last two may be combined and be called the processor.

cache memory is a buffer for the DRAM memory. SRAM is faster but less dense, hence more expensive than DRAM

abstraction between software and lowest-level software is called the instruction set architecture or, architecture. 
the combination of the basic instruction set and the oS interface for programmers is called application binary interface (ABI)
