Also called an HDD, is an electromechanical device that it stores digital data on magnetic surfaces called platters and retrieves it using read/write heads.

## How it works?
The platter or disk (a non-magnetic material) surface is coated with a ferromagnetic material (a substance that has strong magnetic properties).
Then data is stored in a region within this magnetic material where the magnetization is in a uniform direction or magnetic domain; meaning that the individual magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned with one another and they point in the same direction. Anyways, each domain direction can represent binary data, 0=one direction, 1=the opposite, so pretty much the data is stored as patterns of magnetized regions
