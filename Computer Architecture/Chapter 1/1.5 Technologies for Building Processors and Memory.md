A transistor is an on/off switch controlled by electricity, the integrated circuit (IC) combined dozens to hundreds of transistors. VLSI stands for very large-scale integrated circuit, or a device that contains hundreds of thousands to millions of transistors.

To manufacture a chip, we start by silicon, a substance found in sand, a semiconductor. With a special chemical process, it is possible to add materials to silicon that allow tiny areas to transform into on of three devices.
1. conductors of electricity using either microscopic copper or aluminum wire.
2. insulators from electricity, like plastic sheathing or glass.
3. areas that can conduct or insulate under some condition (as a switch).
transistors are the last, a VLSI circuit is just billions of combinations of all 3.
