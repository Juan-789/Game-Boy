### Definition
to define performance it is hard, as the use case may favour a computer over another, thus one can define it with.
- response time also called execution, is the total time required for the computer to complete a task.
- Throughput or bandwidth - the total amount of work done in a given time
thus, we need multiple performance metrics to measure different things, and benchmarks are personalized for the use, it is different the benchmark for a server than a PMDs.

### Measuring performance
time can be defined in different ways, depending on what we are counting. The most straightforward definition of time is called wall clock time, response time, or elapsed time. These all mean the total time it took to complete a task, including disk accesses, memory accesses, I/O activities, OS overhead - everything.

Clock cycles
