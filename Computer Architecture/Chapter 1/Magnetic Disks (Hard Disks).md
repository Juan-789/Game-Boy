Also called an HDD, is an electromechanical device that it stores digital data on magnetic surfaces called platters and retrieves it using read/write heads.

## How it worked?

The platter or disk (a non-magnetic material) surface is coated with a ferromagnetic material (a substance that has strong magnetic properties). This is important since this will create 
[[Magnetic Domains]]. Anyways, each domain direction can represent binary data, 0=one direction, 1=the opposite, so pretty much the data is stored as patterns of magnetized regions. These regions are written with an electromagnet that can switch around its magnetic field by switching the current, and then it will push the magnetism to the direction it wants, and then there's a reader magnet that translates these magnetic directions into bits.

## How it works now?
very complicated but pretty much it evolved from above
